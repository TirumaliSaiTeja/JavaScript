Conditional Statements
Very often when you write code, you want to perform different actions for differentdecisions.

You can use conditional statements in your code to do this.

In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:

Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is of true
Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed in the code




The switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.



The For/In Loop
The JavaScript for/in statement loops through the properties of an Object in the code
  
  
 The For/Of Loop
The JavaScript for/of statement loops through the values of an iterable object.

It lets you loop over iterable data structures such as Arrays, Strings, Maps, NodeLists



The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.



The break statement "jumps out" of a loop.

The continue statement "jumps over" one iteration in the loop.

  
  ECMAScript 6 was the second major revision to JavaScript.

ECMAScript 6 is also known as ES6 and ECMAScript 2015.

This chapter describes the most important features of ES6.
